A multi-user [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social) client for iOS.

## Getting Started

Tootbot must be built with [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 8.3 or later. The [xcode-install](https://github.com/KrauseFx/xcode-install) gem can help with multiple installed Xcode versions.

Tootbot uses [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) for dependency management. Make sure to open the `Tootbot.xcworkspace` workspace, not the `Tootbot.xcodeproj` project.
